                In a country where a portion of people lives below the poverty line and cannot afford two times meal, an institute is sharing their sorrows and making Pakistan proud. Saylani Welfare International Trust was founded on 5th May, 1999 by Maulana Bashir Farooq Qadri. Maulana is a spiritual personality who works on the ideology of Hazrat Umar Faqoor (R.A). Mission of Saylani Welfare International Trust is based on Ayat 92 Surah ALI ‘IMRAN:
                [Never will you attain the good [reward] until you spend [in the way of Allah ] from that which you love. And whatever you spend – indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.] Surah Al-i’Imran:92
